    <h2>TCP</h2>
    <p>TCP stands for <b>Transmission Control Protocol</b><br><br><u>It is the most reliable protocol</u> for information transfer as it ensures that all data is transfered correctly and in the correct order.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>UDP</h2>
    <p>UDP stands for <strong>User Datagram Protocol</strong> <br><br> <i><u>It is much faster than TCP</i></u> at the cost of unreliabilty, it does not make sure that the data is transferred correctly or in sequence.</p>
